# 📊 Sales Data Analysis

This project explores comprehensive sales data from an online retail company to derive insights such as sales performance by month, top-selling products, popular purchase combinations, and optimal advertising times.

The analysis was performed using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and Python’s built-in tools to clean, manipulate, and visualize data from multiple months of sales.
